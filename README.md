note to anyone who want to check my midterm 

how to operate this? just follow the instruction cuz even i get confused with my php files hehe...


use the exam_db.sql and create a database
make sure name of the database is --> exam_db 
just import the exam_db.sql into that

move this folder to xampp htdocs

to operate the website go to the login page
    localhost/exam_db/l_login_page.php

register an account 
then login

and you can test it now...very simple

just as simple as that sheesh sheebar mind break...



by the way just ignore the php file with z_exam
    z_exam_index.php
    z_exam_order.php
    z_exam_checkout.php

thats my answer to part v order module
it's just the same with the function in the main php files, it is just the user interface tho with no functionality
what so ever

di ko ma paste ung full code kasi too large ayaw i-accept kaya yung UI nalang nilagay ko

thanks
